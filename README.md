# Can of Books App

**Author**:  Donna Ada & Ike Steoger

**Version**: 1.1.0 - Book model is fully working CRUD.
1.0.0 - setup repo, got base code working with mongoDB and a Book model

## Overview

Display books in an easy to read & enjoy format for users to interact with. This repo will be the backend of the application, creating calls to the MongoDB cloud.

## Getting Started

In order to get this code working you need to fill in the `.env` file after cloning the whole repo. You also would need a link to a MongoDB database.

## Architecture

This application uses `cors`, `dotenv`, `express` and `mongoose`.

### Team Agreement

What hours will you be available to communicate?
> 0900-1200 / 1300-1800 Pacific Standard Time (PST)

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone â€¦)?
> Slack

How often will you take breaks?
> As often as needed as long as work is getting done, and we'll try to take a break once an hour.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
> We will communicate concerns as early as possible so we can help each other out and deliver the project on time.

Make a list of each person's strengths.
> Ike: JavaScript and Functionality  
> Donna:  CSS and JS

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
> We plan on switching off tasks so we are not strictly working on frontend or backend. However, we can help out in each other's areas of strength as needed to ensure that the project is completed efficiently.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
> One team member wants to get better at styling, especially in React, while the other member wants to get better/quicker at backend coding.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
> We will review the changes on both ends of the code each day & see how things have changed and are working.

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing, or if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
> We will have an open, friendly conversation about the issue, reminding each other that we are both on this learning journey together. We will strive to distribute the workload evenly and approach each other with questions often.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
> Ask questions often!
